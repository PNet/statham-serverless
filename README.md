# Statham Serverless

Statham is an application made in Node.js over Lambda of AWS, this means that the application runs on the cloud of amazon so its cost is only the time and the memory that takes the execution of the code in real time.

Statham acts as a sender of HTTP POST requests, with an algorithm that **tries** a determinated amount of attempts to send a message. 
When it reaches that number of attempts, Statham will notify to a given email the failure.

## Requirement

- Account AWS
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)
- Serverless Framework `npm install -g serverless`
- Authorized email address

## Instalation

### Clone the repo then cd into that folder

* `git clone https://github.com/PNet/statham-serverless`
* `cd statham-serverless`

### Download dependencies

On statham-serverless folder open a terminal:

* ```npm install```

After that, npm should have created a folder named node_modules with all the libraries listed in the `packages.json` file.

### Setting Statham

Set your AWS credentials and secret token on the file 'credentials.json.sample' and rename it to 'credentials.json'.

Into the file 'config.json' you have to set the values:
* CycleExpression: The expresion that defines how much time will wait Statham to do another attempt. For more info about scheduler expressions visit [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html).
* TriesNum: Number of times that Statham tries to send a message before sending a rep√≥rt to the email into *EmailNotification* parameter.
* EmailNotification: A Email direction to send the report when statham reached the max number of attempts (*TriesNum*). This Email have to be configured in SES.

### Config Email in SES

In order to use the SES service of amazon it is necessary to authenticate an e-mail address, this means to integrate the SNS and DKIM for the correct functioning of the messaging.

This step can not be performed using statham deploy, so it is required to perform manually.

[Configurate Email SES](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-west-2#verified-senders-email:)

[Help with the configuration of SNS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/configure-sns-notifications.html#configure-feedback-notifications-console)

[Help with the configuration of DKIM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html)

## Deploying

On a terminal into statham-serverless folder:

* `serverless deploy` or `sls deploy`

Now you will have three endpoints availables to make requests to Statham, more info [here](https://github.com/PNet/statham-serverless/wiki)

## Testing Statham on development

Statham integrates the modules to be automatically raised in your virtual machine and so you can testify their functionality between your applications in the development environment you have, this functionality is done thanks to Docker so we make sure that regardless of the environment, the software is always executed in the same way.
When installed locally, the SQS and SES service will not be working, but will not generate errors when Statham requires its services when retrying a message, so only the correct send service between applications will be available (/receiver endpoint).

- Docker 1.12.2+
- Docker Compose 1.8.1+

#### Proxy

You need to run an instance of [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/PNet/nginx-proxy).
Then add `statham.dev.archdaily.com` to your `/etc/hosts` file pointing to your
docker host.

### Installation

Run the project with:

* `docker-compose up --build -d`

That's going to run the migrations automatically.
